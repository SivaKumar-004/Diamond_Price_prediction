# Diamond Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on their attributes using machine learning. It includes data analysis, visualization, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from a publicly available repository and includes features such as:
- Carat
- Cut
- Color
- Clarity
- Depth
- Table
- Dimensions (x, y, z)
- Price

## Project Highlights

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Visualized trends between categorical and numerical features with respect to price
- Built and evaluated regression models to predict diamond prices
- Used feature engineering to improve model accuracy

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SivaKumar-004/Diamond_Price_prediction
cd Diamond_Price_prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the script using Python:
python diamond_price_prediction.py

Or explore it in a Jupyter Notebook if preferred.
Requirements
See requirements.txt for dependencies.
Results

Visualization of price trends based on clarity, cut, and color
Regression model with evaluation metrics such as RMSE
Feature importance analysis
